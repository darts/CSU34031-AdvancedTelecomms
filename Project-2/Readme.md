### Introduction

#### The problem:  

The problem description asked us to create a secure social media application that would allow individuals to choose who can decrypt their posts on the platform, to others the post would look like ciphertext.

Since the description of the problem was quite broad I decided to approach it as follows:  
Building a social media application in the style of a message board forum. All 'threads' and posts within those threads are visible.

Another client allows the user to use the platform in an encrypted manner. It hides unencrypted posts and posts where 



For the purposes of this project:
public/private key pairs are stored on the server - I know this is bad, ideally the private key would be stored on the client device or encrypted in some way.

Logins are not very secure - ideally this would be done through a oauth system like "login with google" or "login with facebook"
